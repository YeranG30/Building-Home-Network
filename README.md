# Building-Home-Network
I built a home network using Cisco Packet Tracer, where I added and interconnected a PC, a laptop, and a cable modem. I configured these devices for network communication, set up both wired and wireless connections, and tested their connectivity to ensure everything was functioning correctly.


In my Cisco Packet Tracer project, I successfully set up a basic home network. Here's a brief overview of the steps I followed:

# Initial Setup:

- I started by adding key network devices to the workspace: a PC, a laptop, and a cable modem. This laid the foundation for my network infrastructure.

# Establishing Connections:

- For connectivity, I used a copper straight-through cable to connect the PC to the wireless router and another to link the wireless router to the cable modem. Additionally, a coaxial cable connected the cable modem to the internet cloud, establishing an external network link.

# Network Device Setup:

  I configured the PC for a wired network connection, ensuring DHCP was enabled for automatic IP address allocation. I also verified its connectivity by issuing a ping test.

# Wireless Configuration for the Laptop:

To set up the laptop for wireless access, I replaced its Ethernet NIC with a wireless NIC. After powering on the laptop, I successfully connected it to the wireless network.

# Final Verification:

- I concluded the project by using the 'ipconfig' command on both the PC and the laptop to confirm their network configurations and ensure everything was set up correctly.
